# From loading we know we have 303 rows.

# From info we know all the columns correspond to 303 non-null rows, except for Thal, which only corresponds to 301. 
So odds are the 2 items of data that need cleanup per the info I have can probably by located using this property.

# Using null masking, I am able to locate the Thal nulls, at rows 87 and 266. 

# I used drop to remove them using their indices.

# As for duplicates, boolean masking indicated there were none.

# A quick visual inspection confirms all columns have the data they should. I didn't run any code for this purpose because, for the given data set, it didn't seem necessary.

# Apparently no outliers in age. Sex is binary.

# For RestBP, we have six outliers

# Outlier handling Algo:
    1. Check boxplot to visually confirm whether you actually have outliers to deal with
    2. If there are, find out the column's median
    3. Calculate upper and lower bounds using quantiles.
    4. Filter data frame using boolean indexing to locate outliers
    5. print them to confirm visually as a second form of confirmation
    6. Replace them with the median
    7. Check boxplot again to ensure removal went without any unexpected issues
