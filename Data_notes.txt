# From loading we know we have 303 rows.

# From info we know all the columns correspond to 303 non-null rows, except for Thal, which only corresponds to 301. 
So odds are the 2 items of data that need cleanup per the info I have can probably by located using this property.

# Using null masking, I am able to locate the Thal nulls, at rows 87 and 266. 

# I used drop to remove them using their indices.

# As for duplicates, boolean masking indicated there were none.

# A quick visual inspection confirms all columns have the data they should. I didn't run any code for this purpose because, for the given data set, it didn't seem necessary.

# Apparently no outliers in age. Sex is binary.

# For RestBP, we have six outliers

# Outlier handling Algo:
    1. Check boxplot to visually confirm whether you actually have outliers to deal with
    2. If there are, find out the column's median
    3. Calculate upper and lower bounds using quantiles.
    4. Filter data frame using boolean indexing to locate outliers
    5. print them to confirm visually as a second form of confirmation
    6. Replace them with the median
    7. Check boxplot again to ensure removal went ahead without any unexpected issues

# Cholestrol done

# Fbs is a binary, RestECG has no outliers as it's a range of 0 to 2.

# MaxHR dealt with

# ExAng is a binary, no outliers.

# I don't understand what Oldpeak is, but too much of it apparently indicates compromised 
Blood Supply to the heart

# Oldpeak outliers handled

# No outliers in slope

# Ca outliers cleaned up

# Thal is a blood disease

# Medical background:
    1. Obviously, older people are at higher risk of heart disease.
    2. Higher cholesterol and higher Blood pressure are big causes of heart disease.
    3. Anginal chest pain may indicate coronary heart disease
    4. nonanginal pain is, by definition, not cardiac-related
    5. ExAng may indicate Coronary heart disease
    6. Both typical and Atypical chest pain could potentially indicate cardio or pulmonary issues
    7. Lower-than-age-average heart rate under a stress test may indicate further cardiac issues
    8. Men tend to develop heart disease earlier than women, due to hormonal differences
    9. Men also have a generally higher risk of heart disease

# For now at least, I will focus on the relationship between age, sex, and heart disease.

# 205 men to 96 women

# 163 healthy people to 138 sick people

# OBSERVATION 1: Most Sick people are Men, 113 to 25. So 81.88% are men

# OBSERVATION 2: While sick people were older than the average person(56), men got sick earlier than women (58 to 60 years).

# Sex Is obviously a big factor

# OBSERVATION 3: Sick people have a higher cholestrol than the median person, 249 to 242

# OBSERVATION 4: Surprisingly, RestBP was not as much of a factor: the average blood pressure of a sick person was the 
same as the overall median, as well as that of Healthy people

# Observation 5: Sick people tends to have lower median maximum heart rate than healthy
# People, also lower than median (161 healthy, 142.5 sick, 153 median)

# Blood pressure doesn't seem to be much affected by sex

# As for cholesterol, women seem to have a higher median than men

# MaxHR seems to go down with age, which makes sense, given it's correlated with heart disease and heart disease is also 
correlated with age

# Apparently the factor most correlated with heart disease is ExAng (0.43), Then Oldpeak (0.42), per the heatmap.

# So I have 2 categorical columns to handle: ChestPain and Thal

# There are 3 categories in Thal: fixed, normal, and reversible, and 4 in ChestPain: Typical, nontypical, asymptomatic and nonanginal.

# Currently at scaling.

# I will exclude my Sex, Fbs, RestECG, ExAng, Slope, and Ca since the variance in them is low enough that the risk of them
dominating or skewing the model is very low, per gemini.

# Now for training the model, you import it, then initialize it, then fit it with training x and y data.
Just like that, the model is trained. The tuning is where the real work is.
