# From loading we know we have 303 rows.

# From info we know all the columns correspond to 303 non-null rows, except for Thal, which only corresponds to 301. 
So odds are the 2 items of data that need cleanup per the info I have can probably by located using this property.

# Using null masking, I am able to locate the Thal nulls, at rows 87 and 266. 

# I used drop to remove them using their indices.

# As for duplicates, boolean masking indicated there were none.

# A quick visual inspection confirms all columns have the data they should. I didn't run any code for this purpose because, for the given data set, it didn't seem necessary.

# Apparently no outliers in age. Sex is binary.

# For RestBP, we have six outliers

# Outlier handling Algo:
    1. Check boxplot to visually confirm whether you actually have outliers to deal with
    2. If there are, find out the column's median
    3. Calculate upper and lower bounds using quantiles.
    4. Filter data frame using boolean indexing to locate outliers
    5. print them to confirm visually as a second form of confirmation
    6. Replace them with the median
    7. Check boxplot again to ensure removal went ahead without any unexpected issues

# Cholestrol done

# Fbs is a binary, RestECG has no outliers as it's a range of 0 to 2.

# MaxHR dealt with

# ExAng is a binary, no outliers.

# I don't understand what Oldpeak is, but too much of it apparently indicates compromised 
Blood Supply to the heart

# Oldpeak outliers handled

# No outliers in slope

# Ca outliers cleaned up

# Thal is a blood disease

# Medical background:
    1. Obviously, older people are at higher risk of heart disease.
    2. Higher cholesterol and higher Blood pressure are big causes of heart disease.
    3. Anginal chest pain may indicate coronary heart disease
    4. nonanginal pain is, by definition, not cardiac-related
    5. ExAng may indicate Coronary heart disease
    6. Both typical and Atypical chest pain could potentially indicate cardio or pulmonary issues
    7. Lower-than-age-average heart rate under a stress test may indicate further cardiac issues
    8. Men tend to develop heart disease earlier than women, due to hormonal differences
    9. Men also have a generally higher risk of heart disease

# For now at least, I will focus on the relationship between age, sex, and heart disease.
