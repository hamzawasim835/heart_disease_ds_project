# From loading we know we have 303 rows
# From info we know all the columns correspond to 303 non-null rows, except for Thal, which only corresponds to 301. 
So odds are the 2 items of data that need cleanup per the info I have can probably by located using this property.
# Using null masking, I am able to locate the Thal nulls, at rows 87 and 266. 
# I used drop to remove them using their indices.
# As for duplicates, boolean masking indicated there were none.
